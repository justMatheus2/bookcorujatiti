## 💛 About the Book

**"A Coruja que Sempre Estava Lá"** is a gentle illustrated story about love that remains present even across distance.

The story follows Coruja Titi as she accompanies important moments in the lives of Raposinho Hug and Coelhinha Dassa — even when they are far apart.

It is a comforting bedtime book for babies and toddlers, especially meaningful for families living in different cities or countries.
